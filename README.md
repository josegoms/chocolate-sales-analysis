Later organized into business insights and strategic recommendations.

* Data validation and structural inspection (Excel & Pandas)
* Data transformation and feature engineering (Pandas)
* SQL-based aggregation and segmentation (SQL)
* KPI development (revenue by country, salesperson, month)
* Performance analysis (country, salesperson, product, month)
* Strategic recommendations
* Analytical limitations assessment

# 👨🏻‍💻 Skills demonstrated
* Structured data validation and cleaning
* Feature enginnering (datetime info extracted)
